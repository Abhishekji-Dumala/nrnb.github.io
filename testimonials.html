        code them. GSOC is great because it gets us the extra help we need, even if for a short while. For 
        me at NIH, which has no regular students of an academic institution, it can sometimes be tricky to 
        get summer students, especially good programmers; this helps out in that respect, as well. <b>As a mentor, 
        I see it as an opportunity to help students better understand the biological-sciences community</b>, 
        especially if they are coming from something like a computer science background, and the opportunity 
        to go through the whole process of blank code window to an academic publication of that work, which I

        the GSoC NRNB training program, I have learned tremendously about network biology and decided to 
        build my research career in this area. After my Ph.D graduation in 2011, I joined one of the NRNB 
        investigator -- Chris Sander's lab at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. My first project as 
        a postdoc is a NRNB-supported project: integrating biological pathways / networks in the cBio Cancer 
        Genomics Portal using CytoscapeWeb. In 2012, I became a GSoC mentor for NRNB, co-mentoring a student

        but also how to interact with people over different media (email, video chat,...). Communication is really one of the 
        most important tools that you have to learn because nowadays collaborations will always get bigger and more distant.

        It is fairly easy to get a question answered or a problem solved by someone else's help on the mailing lists, there is always updated training material 
        on the web site--which really helps with the kickstart--and I do appreciate the successful outreach programs that helped me get 
        involved with NRNB and encourage the spread the word. That is definitely why I became a mentor for the GSoC'12 program! Finally 
        here is a great anecdote regarding my involvement in the GSoC program: In 2008 when I was a undergraduate student in Turkey, 
        Jianjiong Gao (then a graduate student in China) and I have worked together on closely related Cytoscape projects during the 
        Google Summer of Code program. Now, in 2012, we are both working with Chris Sander, an NRNB PI, and we have been working 
        side-by-side for almost two years now at the same lab (he as a post-doc and I as a graduate student). We have even co-mentored 
        a GSoC student this year and will hopefully do the same for the following year's program."</p></blockquote2>

        <blockquote2><p>"The first time I was involved in the GSoC program, I was an undergraduate (studying Molecular Biology and Genetics) and I had been mainly 
        doing wet-lab experiments as part of my training program (Bogazici University, Turkey). I always had an interest in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, 
        but never had experience in working in a well-defined project. In 2008, as GSoC student, I had the opportunity to work on a well-defined project for 
        three-months, and this definitely helped me make my mind up to apply graduate school and pursue my education in Computational Biology. During the graduate 
        school applications, being part of the program really helped in proving my experience to the graduate school committee (especially during the interviews). 
        I am now part of the Tri-Institutional Training Program in Computational Biology and Medicine and I believe NRNB&GSoC has an invaluable contribution in 
        this."</p></blockquote2>

        postdoc in Trey's lab helped me import my data into Cytoscape and analyze the data based on previously 
        reported protein - protein interactions. Unfortunately, my data quality was not fantastic and even with 
        the excellent help of the Ideker lab we were unable to further this analysis further. This was mostly an 
        application based collaboration. This project is still not published but the help from the Ideker lab was 
        generous and somewhat helpful."</p></blockquote2>

        the input by Drs Saito and Ideker was of utmost importance: we developed an autophagy focused interaction network 
        and analyzed this by standard and novel bioinformatic tool sets; other projects within our lab also greatly 
        benefitted from this collaboration in that we used network tools to describe yeast pathways. Several publications

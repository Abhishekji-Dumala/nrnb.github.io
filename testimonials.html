        the Cytoscape community rapidly progressed into mentoring a GSOC project with an excellent applicant. Ultimately I 
        gained the dynamic network visualization tool that I sought, along with experience as a mentor, experience in open-source

        Currently, I'm participating for a last time as a student in NRNB GSoC, and after my upcoming graduation I am definitely interested 
        in continuing my involvement with this great community. If it weren't for NRNB training programs, I would have never got in touch

        benefitted from this collaboration in that we used network tools to describe yeast pathways. Several publications

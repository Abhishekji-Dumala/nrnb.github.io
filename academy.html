			<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

			<p>
				If you are familiar with the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google
					Summer of Code program</a>, then you have the basic idea. The main
				difference is that this is a year-round program, accommodating
				students and non-students with flexible project dates ranging from 2
				to 12 months. Another difference is that it is a 100% unfunded,
				volunteer experience. But from <a
					href="http://nextnucleus.org/?p=188">past testimonials</a>, you'll
				see that there are rewards greater than mere cash. Also browse the
				list of <a href="gsoc/alumni.html"> accepted NRNB Academy
					participants and their projects</a>.
			<p>NRNB Academy organizes and matches projects and participants,
				providing structure, guidelines and outreach. The details and
				execution of each project is ultimately in the hands of you and your
				mentor. Most participants work remotely, staying in touch and
				coordinating with mentors and other project contributors via email,
				IRC, video chat, phone, etc. If you are near a mentor site or have
				an itch to travel, sometimes office space can be arranged.</p>

			<p>
				<b> Step 1: Determine if the program is right for you.</b> Carefully
				read through the program description and <a href="academy-faq.html">FAQ</a>.
				Contact <a href="mailto:khanspers@gladstone.ucsf.edu">the admin</a>
				with any questions not covered in these pages. <i>Note: asking
					questions answered in the FAQ may count against you!</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Step 2: Browse the current project ideas.</b> We maintain a
				running <a href="academy-ideas.html">list of potential project
					ideas</a>. Do a bit of background research on each idea that interests
				you. Or propose your own project idea related to NRNB tools and
				resources. Fill out the <a href="academy-admissions.html">Admissions
					Form</a> to start the ball rolling.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Step 3: Connect with your potential mentors.</b> After you've
				filled out the Admissions Form, the admin will follow up with you
				directly and put you in contact with your potential mentors. This
				begins the dialog about whether a given project is a good fit for
				you and the mentor.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Step 4: Submit your project proposal for approval.</b> NRNB
				Academy has a rolling enrollment, accepting members year-round. <b><i>Together</i></b>
				with your potential mentor, you will prepare and submit a detailed
				project proposal. Find a template application and instructions in
				the <a href="academy-faq.html">FAQ</a> <i>(which you should have
					already read in Step 1)</i>.

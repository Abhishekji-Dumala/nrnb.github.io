					<p><b>A Gene Ontology Extracted from Molecular Networks (Trey Ideker, UCSD)</b>:<br />
					Ontologies are of key importance to many domains of biological research. The Gene Ontology (GO), 
					in particular, has been instrumental in unifying knowledge about biological processes, 
					cellular components, and molecular functions through a hierarchy of concepts and their 
					interrelationships. However, given only partial biological knowledge and inconsistency in how 
					this knowledge is curated, it has been difficult to construct, extend and validate GO in an 
					unbiased manner. We have recently showed that the existing collection of high-throughput 
					network maps, as are now becoming available, can be analyzed to automatically assemble an 
					ontology of gene function that rivals manually curated efforts [Dutkowski et al. Nat Biotechnol, 
					2013 2013. 31(1): p. 38-45]. Our systematic computational approach (Fig. 1) combines evidence from 
					physical, genetic and transcriptional networks to produce an ontology comprised of 4,123 biological 
					concepts and 5,766 hierarchical concept relations (Fig. 2). Using a new ontology alignment procedure 
					(Fig. 1), we found that the network-based ontology captures the majority of known cellular components 
					and identifies approximately 600 new cellular components and component relations – many of which we 
					were able to validate either experimentally or bioinformatically. By working closely with the GO curators, 
					we were able to incorporate selected new components and relations into the Gene Ontology, thus providing 
					proof-of-principle for how to systematically update and revise the GO structure based on large-scale data. 
					</p>
					<p>The network-extracted ontology is a new resource for systems and synthetic biology – i.e. a data-driven 
					catalogue of cellular machinery, from genes, to complexes, to pathways and higher-order processes. It 
					provides a powerful tool for performing multi-scale analysis of biological networks, including automatically 
					identifying, annotating and visualizing the complete hierarchical structure. We also show how integrating 
					the ontology with additional high-throughput datasets leads to identification of new components and 
					processes altered in human disease. Based on our results, we suggest a new role for ontologies in 
					bioinformatics: rather than merely being used as a gold-standard for performing functional enrichment, 
					ontologies should serve as evolvable models that are validated, revised, and expanded based on new genomic data.</p>
					<p>Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how the network-extracted ontology can further be extended. 
					For instance while NeXO represents a rigorous approach to capture ontology terms and term relations, the 
					ability to systematically annotate the type of relation that occurs between terms (e.g. “is a”, “part of”, 
					“regulates”) poses a separate and very interesting challenge. An in-depth investigation is needed to assess 
					which network properties are best at separating the different types of relations, and whether there are 
					additional data sets that might be brought to bear on this problem (Stage 3). Similarly, while NeXO 
					identifies the majority of known cellular components, it will be interesting to further investigate 
					what types of network data could be used to increase the coverage of biological processes and molecular 
					functions. Finally, a key question is whether enough high-quality data exist to build NeXO ontologies for 
					other species, particularly human, and, whether it is better to structure a common ontology for all species, 
					as has been done in GO, or to focus on individual species-specific ontologies.</p>

					<b>Figure 1: Automated assembly and alignment of gene ontologies.</b> (A) Probabilistic community detection within 
					the input networks yields a binary tree in which nodes correspond to ontology terms and links correspond to 
					parent-child term relations. Unsupported terms are replaced by multi-way joins, and additional parent-child 
					relations are added based on network data. The resulting ontology is aligned against the Gene Ontology, 
					in a way that (B) prohibits non-unique mappings and ancestor-descendant criss-crossing.
					
					<img src="images/IdekerF2.png" width="700" /><br /> <b>Figure 2:</b>
					The NeXO ontology is shown as a tree, with nodes indicating terms and edges indi-cating hierarchical 
					relations between terms, i.e. that one term contains another. Node sizes indi-cate the number of genes assigned 
					to a term. Node colors represent the degree of correspon-dence to a term in GO as determined by ontology alignment, 
					with high-level alignments labeled. Insets show the hierarchy identi-fied for the ribosome and actin cytoskeleton.
					
					<p><b>Network Analysis Tools for Cancer Genomics (Chris Sander, MSKCC):</b><br />This project is focused on building 
					network analysis tools for interpreting high-throughput cancer genomic data sets to identify altered disease 
					networks and enable the identification of network-based biomarkers in cancer. Our primary focus is building 
					user-friendly, open source tools for visualizing and analyzing multidimensional cancer genomic data sets 
					(including copy number, mutation, and mRNA expression) in the context of known biological pathways and 
					interaction networks, and making these tools broadly available to clinical, experimental and computational 
					investigators within the cancer research community. Providing such tools to the cancer research community 
					is critical, as numerous large-scale projects, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and the 
					International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), are profiling dozens of cancer types and subtypes. Identifying 
					altered pathways and networks within each of these cancer types remains a critical and open challenge.</p>
					<p>During our first several years of NRNB funding, we completed a prototype project for displaying 
					multi-dimensional cancer genomic data in the context of molecular interaction networks. We chose to 
					implement the prototype in CytoscapeWeb [1], as CytoscapeWeb does not require any additional software 
					installation or require Java Web Start. It therefore significantly lowers the barriers for usage, 
					particularly for biologists and clinical researchers ­­­­- two of our main target user groups.
					We transitioned our tools from prototype to production mode, and have made our software available 
					to the entire cancer research community. Cancer researchers are now using these tools to perform 
					network analysis on up to 20 different cancer types, including TCGA-funded projects, such as glioblastoma 
					multiforme (GBM) [2] and serous ovarian cancer [3].</p>
					<p>The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics code base has recently reached a stable state where it is now being 
					considered as a general framework to build our other NRNB-related tools on. Our recently finalized drug-target 
					data support in the context of cBioPortal’s network analysis is one such example. During the past year, 
					we improved the network analysis capabilities of the cBioPortal by providing query and visualization of 
					aggregated drug data from multiple resources. With this new feature, the portal currently contains 
					gene-centric drug-target information from the following resources: DrugBank [8], KEGG Drug [9], 
					<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/alphalist">NCI Cancer Drugs</a>, and Rask-Andersen et al. [10]. 
					Within the network analysis view, drugs are hidden by default, but can be added to the network via the 
					Genes & Drugs menu on the right side of the screen. Users now have the option of displaying FDA-approved 
					drugs, cancer drugs defined by NCI Cancer Drugs, or all drugs targeting the query genes. For example, 
					when the user queries for the gene EGFR in the portal, we not only show the network context of this gene, 
					but also provide information about the drugs targeting the product of this gene: geﬁtinib and erlotinib 
					are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the catalytic domain of EGFR, and cetuximab and trastuzumab 
					are monoclonal antibodies that target the extracellular domain of EGFR and ERBB2, respectively (Fig. 3) [11].</p>
					<img src="images/SanderF1.png" width="700" /><br /> 
					<b>Figure 3: Improved Network tab: Network analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor networks 
					in serous ovarian cancer.</b> (A) Network view of the EGFR and ERBB2 neighborhood in serous ovarian cancer 
					(TCGA data set) rendered by Cytoscape Web. EGFR and ERBB2 are query genes (thick border), and nearest 
					neighbor genes are color coded by their alteration frequency in ovarian cancer. One can display drugs 
					that target EGFR or ERBB2 (hexagons, orange if FDA approved), as well as details about genomic alterations 
					and links to external resources (lower left panel, example MYC). (B) The portal overlays multidimensional 
					genomic data (copy number, mutation, and mRNA expression) onto all nodes in the network. (C) Edges can 
					represent different interaction types (color-coded, such as “reacts with”). (D) Options for filtering, 
					cropping and searching the network of interest.
					<p>Our new drug-target feature is now available as part of the open-access cBioPortal and is helping 
					cancer researchers in exploring the therapy options within the network context of genes of interest. </p>
					<p><b>New Driving Biological Projects:</b>In the next year, we are anticipating improving the network 
					analysis feature in two ways: 1) detailed visualization of the pathways and reactions in the network view; 
					2) inference of indirect drug targets, for potentially interesting therapy options, by using genomic 
					alteration and drug-target data. Currently, interaction types that are shown in the network analysis 
					view are derived from the BioPAX to SIF inference rules [7]. For example: In Same Component indicates 
					that Genes A and B are involved in the same biological component, such as a complex; State Change 
					indicates that Gene A causes a state change, such as a phosphorylation change within Gene B. This 
					reduction from BioPAX to SIF was necessary as the Cytoscape Web framework, by then, was not 
					supporting visualization of more complex elements, such as compartments. With the technology being 
					developed as part of the CSP-100 project (Gary Bader), it recently become feasible to visualize 
					biological networks in a more detailed way, therefore enabling the use of Systems Biology Graphical 
					Notation (SBGN) for better representation of BioPAX. As part of our NRNB collaboration with Ugur 
					Dogrusoz (Bilkent University, Turkey), we are aiming to adopt SBGN-complaint views to visualize 
					multi-dimensional cancer genomics data with the network context (see Figure 3). This project has 
					recently been implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype and is now being integrated into cBioPortal. 
					When complete, this new feature will allow better presentation of proteomics data (e.g. Reverse Phase 
					Protein Array data provided as part of the TCGA network) by allowing users to optionally switch from 
					a gene-centric to protein-centric view.</p>
					<img src="images/SanderF2.png" width="700" /><br /> <b>Figure 3:
					Proposed additions to the current simple network view.</b> On the left is the Simple Interaction 
					derived from BioPAX; on the right is an example visualization of a BioPAX network obtained from Pathway 
					Commons. The latter is utilizing the new visualization capabilities, Systems Biology Graphical Notation 
					(SBGN), of the CytoscapeWeb project. The SBGN view provides a more detailed representation of the 
					pathway and also provides protein-centric view with Proteomics data mapped to specific proteins or 
					phospho-proteins.
					<p>In the next year, we are also planning to utilize genomic alteration and pathway data to infer 
					clinically relevant uses of drug-target data. For this, we intend to use down- and up-stream 
					relationships between genes to suggest drugs of possible interest that can indirectly target a 
					particular genomic alteration event in cancer samples (see Figure 4). One historical example for 
					such cases is the use of AKT inhibitors in patients who bear a homozygous PTEN deletion. Without 
					the gene PTEN and its product, Akt proteins, which are down-stream of PTEN, cannot be suppressed, 
					and therefore are found to be upregulated in cancer samples that have the homozygous PTEN deletion. 
					In the presence of an AKT inhibitor, this up-regulation effect can be counteracted. Another similar 
					example of this concept is the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors when CDKN2A is either mutated or homozygously 
					deleted in cancer cells. Pathway resources, such as Pathway Commons, already provide this type of 
					relationships between genes; and we plan to extract this information in a systematic way and combine 
					it with the drug-target data in order to infer such therapy options in an automatic manner within the 
					cBioPortal framework. This method and the prototype are currently under development. </p>

					<p><b>Network Analysis Methods for Inferring Causality in Signaling Networks (Sander, MSKCC)</b><br />
					The goal of our second TRD project is to develop network analysis tools that algorithmically infer 
					causality within signaling networks and make these tools available. High-throughput screens conducted 
					with libraries of small molecules or inhibitory RNAs have the ability to identify compounds that induce 
					tumor suppressive responses in cancer cells [12]. While the effects of such perturbations can be easily 
					linked to transcriptional changes, identifying the causal mechanism is a main challenge. In collaboration 
					with Somwar and colleagues [13], we used a computational approach to predict the target of a small molecule 
					inducing reduced growth in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Interestingly, experimental follow up confirmed 
					the prediction.</p>
					<p>Building on this concept, we have been working on computational approaches to model causal signaling 
					cascades inducing observed transcriptional changes within perturbed cancer cell lines. We have been 
					exploring the use of optimization algorithms adapted from statistical physics to identify the minimal 
					set of interactions able to connect genes that are differentially expressed after a perturbation, with 
					candidate targets of the same perturbation (Stage 2). This initial approach relied on an algorithm 
					that solves the Steiner-tree problem. Given a set of “terminal” nodes, the Steiner-tree is defined 
					as the tree of minimum weight connecting these terminals, allowing the inclusion of additional nodes. 
					Differentially expressed genes after a perturbation and/or candidate targets of the same perturbation 
					can be used as terminals. Our prediction was that the resulting Steiner-tree could therefore contain 
					both gene interactions able to explain the observed transcriptional changes and the putative target 
					of the perturbation. Within this past year, we determined that this approach does not work as well 
					as expected, and are now in the process of exploring a new algorithmic framework that combines 
					Gaussian graphical models with maximum entropy methods.</p>
					<p><b>New Driving Biological Projects</b><br />A new biological driver for deriving causality networks 
					is inferring causal relationships within data types and between data types, such as copy number 
					changes and cancer genomics. For example, we would like to investigate the relationship between 
					mutations in the TP53 tumor repressor and the complex copy number profile in ovarian cancer. Another 
					example is the exploration of causal relationships between gene mutations. For example, mutations in 
					the POLE gene lead to a characteristic spectrum of mutations in other proteins. We have preliminary 
					results and plan to develop a network analysis approach to identify causal relationships.
					</p><p>We are also considering looking at interactions between microbial subpopulations, starting with 
					the gut microbiome, where a set of interacting bacterial populations change under fluctuating constraints 
					provided by the host and nutrient intake. Recent work has shown the precise composition and evolution 
					of this population is closely coupled to the state of health of the host. Certain deviations from 
					equilibrium present a significant risk of invasion by pathogenic bacteria, as seen with some cancer 
					patients receiving bone marrow transplantations [23]. A more detailed understanding of the relationships 
					between gut microbial subpopulations following such aggressive treatments in the host could inform 
					therapeutic development leading to improved outcomes.</p>

				<h3>Project B: Using Cytoscape for Social Network Research </h3>

				</h4>

				<div class="well">

					<p>
						Social networks are increasingly recognized as having an important
						effect on a wide variety of human behaviors, affecting the spread
						of health outcomes (AIDS, obesity, drinking and smoking behavior),
						emotional states (depression, loneliness, and happiness), and
						political outcomes (legislative activity, judicial decisions, and
						terrorist events). However, the statistical tools used to study
						these effects are drawn from a tradition that focuses on dyads, or
						sets of two people who are socially connected. When we find an
						association in behavior within dyads, we typically cannot
						distinguish three possible explanations. 1) <i>Homophily:</i>
						people might choose to be friends with others because they have
						the same behavior. In other words, birds of a feather might flock
						together. 2) <i>Context:</i> there might be variation in the
						environment than causes both individuals in a dyad to exhibit the
						same behavior. For example, poor neighborhoods might create
						environments that promote less healthy behaviors, causing an
						association between friends who live in the same neighborhood. 3)
						<i>Influence:</i> one person in the dyad actually influences the
						other in some way to cause their behavior to become more like
						their own.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are developing a Network Correlation Cytoscape App in collaboration 
						Dr. Alex Pico. In order to understand why so many behaviors are 
						influenced by social connections, a tool must be developed that is 
						able to determine the variable contribution of a given set of potential 
						causes (such as homophily, context, and influence effects). This 
						technology can then be used to determine the underlying causes behind 
						the spread of various behaviors (health, political, emotional) in networks 
						of different types and across different time points. The emerging techniques 
						and tools will be broadly applicable to the study of social network influence 
						on health behaviors such as eating habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use.

					<p>Biologists frequently use networks to represent the
						structure and function of the cell, using intuitive metaphors to
						reduce multiple levels of spatial and temporal relationships to a
						two-dimensional image. At the same time, computational
						representations of the cell are more abstract and tend to be less
						intuitive for biologists than human-made diagrams. This section
						describes planned improvements to the biological relevance of
						computational visualizations of biological networks in Cytoscape.
						Intuitive biological network visualizations may one day replace
						printed biology textbooks as the primary resource for knowledge
						about cellular processes.</p>
					<p>Imagine being able to view the entire network of genes and
						gene products working in a cell. Then freeze the cell at a moment
						in time, and zoom to visualize the location, state, and
						interconnections of a collection of molecules in a particular
						subcellular location. Zoom in further to identify the splice
						isoforms and variants resulting from that particular genome being
						processed in that tissue, at that time, under specific conditions.
						We are a long way from such an ideal cellular exploration system.
						Instead, biological systems are typically visualized as "ball and
						stick" networks that include only pairwise connections between
						nodes. This representation has many limitations, such as the
						inability to convey detailed knowledge about biological processes
						and their dynamics (e.g. biochemical reactions which are three-way
						relationships between metabolic substrates, products, and enzymes)
						and poor visualization of very large numbers of nodes and links as
						are present in the cell (e.g. resulting in visual "hairballs").</p>
					<p>To overcome these challenges, we are develop new methods for visualizing 
					and exploring very large biological networks that reduce visual complexity 
					and enhance cognitive value compared to the traditional network display. These 
					approaches will exploit the hierarchical and modular organization of biological 
					networks and the large amount of information available about nodes and edges, 
					such as Gene Ontology annotations of gene function. We are developing visualization 
					methods in the following areas: 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Simplifying network views by hierarchically
								organizing networks and their modules.</b> Biological networks are
							inherently modular (e.g. pathways and complexes) and hierarchical
							(e.g. sub-pathways and complex subunits). Biological networks are inherently 
							modular (e.g. pathways and complexes) and hierarchical (e.g. sub-pathways and 
							complex subunits). We are developing methods to organize networks hierarchically 
							and to visually explore these hierarchies.  
							First, we will identify modular structures in the
							network using a set of known modules (e.g. from gene annotation)
							or by using existing clustering approaches and module detection
							methods developed in TRD A, B and currently available in
							Cytoscape. Next, modules will be rendered visually as individual
							nodes connected by their inter-module relationships. This module
							network is potentially hierarchical, in that each module defines
							a sub-network, which may also contain modules. Visualization
							methods will support modules with hidden or visible child nodes
							and module overlap (e.g. for protein complexes that share
							subunits). New automatic layout algorithms will be developed to
							clearly organize modular, hierarchical networks using
							partitioning and module-defined layout templates.</li>
						<li><b>Showing only the information needed across multiple levels of detail 
						(semantic zooming) and data sources (information layering).</b> The complete 
						view of a large protein interaction network would be extremely cluttered if 
						it included all protein details, such as the sequences or structures of all 
						proteins. Ideally, as the user zooms in to progressively focus in on an area 
						of interest, more details about that area are shown (semantic zooming). Further, 
						users should be able to select information of interest to be viewed on the network 
						(information layering). We will develop methods to interactively navigate networks 
						across multiple levels of detail, from whole cell to subfeatures of a node 
						(e.g. protein domains, exons). This will support multiple biological network types, 
						such as pathways and protein interaction networks, via the visualization of different 
						types of biological details at the module level (e.g. exons, splice sites, polymorphisms, 
						miRNA target sites, protein domains and post-translational modifications) and at the 
						molecular group level (complexes, paralogs, haplotypes, chromosomal regions and pathways). 
						We will develop information layer-based visualization strategies, where node and edge 
						attributes, such as gene expression profiles, will be represented as different layers 
						that can be interactively switched on and off.</li>
						<li><b>Simultaneously viewing network attributes
							collected from many biological experiments.</b> Proteins and genes in biological 
							networks are associated with an increasing amount of data from multiple experiments, 
							such as gene expression from time-series or across normal and disease states. Ideally, 
							this multi-dimensional information would be visualized in the context of networks. 
							We are extending Cytoscape to support new types of visualizations to enable multiple 
							node and edge data to be visualized at the same time.</li>
						<li><b>Analyzing Complex Networks Using Ontologies.</b>The development of high-throughput 
						technology has given rise to an enormous increase of data on biomolecular expression and 
						interactions, which results in protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, 
						signaling networks and metabolic networks. One approach to understanding networks relies on 
						ontologies, such as Gene Ontology, and enrichment analysis. We are developing network functional 
						analysis methods that take into consideration network topology. Our NOA app implements the NOA 
						algorithm for network-based enrichment analysis, which extends Gene Ontology annotations to 
						network links, or edges. The NOA app facilitates the annotation and analysis of one or more 
						networks in Cytoscape according to user-defined parameters. In addition to tables, the NOA 
						app also presents results in the form of heatmaps and overview networks in Cytoscape, which 
						can be exported for publication figures.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Researchers need tools to not only aid in the collection and
						processing of large-scale datasets, but also to make sense of the
						data in the familiar context of biological pathways. The
						visualization methods that we will develop will enable a view of
						the cell that is intuitive to biologists and that leads them
						quickly to new discoveries - where a researcher exclaims "Aha! Now
						I understand the relationships in my data and can formulate a new
						hypothesis!" as a result of exploring a network in Cytoscape.</p>

					<p>The Cyni Toolbox app is available from the Cytoscape App Store (link) and is also available 
					here (http://www.proteomics.fr/Sysbio/CyniProject). Data imputation and discretization techniques 
					are provided along with several known inference algorithms to make this tool fully operational for 
					any kind of inference requirement. While data imputation and discretization techniques allow you 
					modify Cytoscape tables, network inference algorithms produce a new network after applying the chosen technique.
				
					<p>Cyni Toolbox is not only an application to perform a result, but it also provides a framework 
					for other app developers to facilitate the implementation of other algorithms. The goal of the 
					Cyni framework is to provide standardized, extensible and configurable default solutions for all 
					components different from the core algorithms, such as GUI, parameter handling, and configuration 
					of distance/similarity measures. Thereby, developers can focus on their core expertise. Tutorials 
					are available for Cyni Toolbox users as well as for developing new algorithms through Cyni.</p>

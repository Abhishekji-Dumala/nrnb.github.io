					<h4>A Gene Ontology Extracted from Molecular Networks (Trey Ideker, UCSD)</h4>
					<p>Ontologies are of key importance to many domains of biological research. 
					The Gene Ontology (GO), in particular, has been instrumental in unifying 
					knowledge about biological processes, cellular components, and molecular 
					functions through a hierarchy of concepts and their interrelationships. 
					However, given only partial biological knowledge and inconsistency in how 
					this knowledge is curated, it has been difficult to construct, extend and 
					validate GO in an unbiased manner. We have recently showed that the existing 
					collection of high-throughput network maps, as are now becoming available, 
					can be analyzed to automatically assemble an ontology of gene function that 
					rivals manually curated efforts [1]. Our systematic computational approach 
					(Fig. 1) combines evidence from physical, genetic and transcriptional 
					networks to produce an ontology comprised of 4,123 biological concepts and 
					5,766 hierarchical concept relations (Fig. 2). Using a new ontology alignment 
					procedure (Fig. 1), we found that the network-based ontology captures the 
					majority of known cellular components and identifies approximately 600 new 
					cellular components and component relations – many of which we were able to 
					validate either experimentally or bioinformatically. By working closely with 
					the GO curators, we were able to incorporate selected new components and 
					relations into the Gene Ontology, thus providing proof-of-principle for how 
					to systematically update and revise the GO structure based on large-scale 
					data. 
					</p>
					<p>The network-extracted ontology is a new resource for systems and synthetic
					biology – i.e. a data-driven catalogue of cellular machinery, from genes, to 
					complexes, to pathways and higher-order processes. It provides a powerful 
					tool for performing multi-scale analysis of biological networks, including 
					automatically identifying, annotating and visualizing the complete 
					hierarchical structure. We also show how integrating the ontology with 
					additional high-throughput datasets leads to identification of new components
					and processes altered in human disease. Based on our results, we suggest a 
					new role for ontologies in bioinformatics: rather than merely being used as 
					a gold-standard for performing functional enrichment, ontologies should serve
					as evolvable models that are validated, revised, and expanded based on new 
					genomic data.</p>
					<p>Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how the network-extracted 
					ontology can further be extended. For instance while NeXO represents a 
					rigorous approach to capture ontology terms and term relations, the ability 
					to systematically annotate the type of relation that occurs between terms 
					(e.g. “is a”, “part of”, “regulates”) poses a separate and very interesting 
					challenge. An in-depth investigation is needed to assess which network 
					properties are best at separating the different types of relations, and 
					whether there are additional data sets that might be brought to bear on this 
					problem. Similarly, while NeXO identifies the majority of known cellular 
					components, it will be interesting to further investigate what types of 
					network data could be used to increase the coverage of biological processes 
					and molecular functions. Finally, a key question is whether enough 
					high-quality data exist to build NeXO ontologies for other species, 
					particularly human, and, whether it is better to structure a common ontology 
					for all species, as has been done in GO, or to focus on individual 
					species-specific ontologies.

					<b>Figure 1: Automated assembly and alignment of gene ontologies.</b> (A) 
					Probabilistic community detection within the input networks yields a binary 
					tree in which nodes correspond to ontology terms and links correspond to 
					parent-child term relations. Unsupported terms are replaced by multi-way 
					joins, and additional parent-child relations are added based on network data. The resulting ontology is aligned against the Gene Ontology, 
					in a way that (B) prohibits non-unique mappings and ancestor-descendant
					criss-crossing.
					
					<img src="images/IdekerF2.png" width="700" /><br /> <b>Figure 2:</b>
					The NeXO ontology is shown as a tree, with nodes indicating terms and edges 
					indicating hierarchical relations between terms, i.e. that one term contains 
					another. Node sizes indicate the number of genes assigned to a term. Node 
					colors represent the degree of correspon-dence to a term in GO as determined 
					by ontology alignment, with high-level alignments labeled. Insets show the 
					hierarchy identified for the ribosome and actin cytoskeleton.

					<h4>Network Analysis Tools for Cancer Genomics (Chris Sander, MSKCC)</h4>
					<p>This project is focused on building network analysis tools for 
					interpreting high-throughput cancer genomic data sets to identify altered 
					disease networks and enable the identification of network-based biomarkers in
					cancer. Our primary focus is building user-friendly, open source tools for 
					visualizing and analyzing multidimensional cancer genomic data sets 
					(including copy number, mutation, and mRNA expression) in the context of 
					known biological pathways and interaction networks, and making these tools 
					broadly available to clinical, experimental and computational investigators 
					within the cancer research community. Providing such tools to the cancer 
					research community is critical, as numerous large-scale projects, including 
					the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and the International Cancer Genome 
					Consortium (ICGC), are profiling dozens of cancer types and subtypes. 
					Identifying altered pathways and networks within each of these cancer types 
					remains a critical and open challenge.</p>
					
					<p>During our first several years of NRNB funding, we completed a prototype 
					project for displaying multi-dimensional cancer genomic data in the context 
					of molecular interaction networks. We chose to implement the prototype in 
					CytoscapeWeb [1], as CytoscapeWeb does not require any additional software 
					installation or require Java Web Start. It therefore significantly lowers the
					barriers for usage, particularly for biologists and clinical researchers ­
					-- two of our main user groups. We transitioned our tools from prototype to 
					production mode, and have made our software available to the entire cancer 
					research community. Cancer researchers are now using these tools to perform 
					network analysis on up to 20 different cancer types, including TCGA-funded 
					projects, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [2] and serous ovarian cancer
					[3].</p>
					
					<p>The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics code base has recently reached a stable
					state where it is now being considered as a general framework to build our 
					other NRNB-related tools on. Our recently finalized drug-target data support 
					in the context of cBioPortal’s network analysis is one such example. During 
					the past year, we improved the network analysis capabilities of the 
					cBioPortal by providing query and visualization of aggregated drug data from 
					multiple resources. With this new feature, the portal currently contains 
					gene-centric drug-target information from the following resources: DrugBank 
					[8], KEGG Drug [9], 
					<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/alphalist">NCI Cancer 
					Drugs</a>, and Rask-Andersen et al. [10]. Within the network analysis view, 
					drugs are hidden by default, but can be added to the network via the Genes & 
					Drugs menu on the right side of the screen. Users now have the option of 
					displaying FDA-approved drugs, cancer drugs defined by NCI Cancer Drugs, or 
					all drugs targeting the query genes. For example, when the user queries for 
					the gene EGFR in the portal, we not only show the network context of this 
					gene, but also provide information about the drugs targeting the product of 
					this gene: geﬁtinib and erlotinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target 
					the catalytic domain of EGFR, and cetuximab and trastuzumab are monoclonal 
					antibodies that target the extracellular domain of EGFR and ERBB2, 
					respectively (Fig. 1) [11].

					factor receptor networks in serous ovarian cancer.</b> (A) Network view of 
					the EGFR and ERBB2 neighborhood in serous ovarian cancer (TCGA data set)

					and nearest neighbor genes are color coded by their alteration frequency in 
					ovarian cancer. One can display drugs that target EGFR or ERBB2 (hexagons, 
					orange if FDA approved), as well as details about genomic alterations 
					and links to external resources (lower left panel, example MYC). (B) The

					<br /><br />
					Our new drug-target feature is now available as part of the open-access 
					cBioPortal and is helping cancer researchers in exploring the therapy options
					within the network context of genes of interest. </p>
					
					<p><b>Outreach Plans</b><br />
					Since its launch in mid-2010, the cBioPortal has been extensively used by 
					cancer researchers around the globe, particularly by The Cancer Genome Atlas 
					TCGA) network. The portal currently attracts more than 1,500 unique visitors 
					per week. In order to help researchers use cBioPortal in their studies, we 
					are actively communicating with various communities, such as the TCGA network
					and publicizing the tool through different channels.</p>
					
					<p>During the last year, we have adapted and are currently maintaining an e-mail 
					list for users who have questions regarding the use of the cBioPortal. This 
					e-mail list and the questions answered by our group are publicly available at
					our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cbioportal/">Google Groups page</a>. 
					Furthermore we have recently completed a manuscript that explains the use cases 
					of cBioPortal and its network analysis feature in details in order to 
					encourage wider adaptation. We believe this publication (Science Signaling) 
					will help researchers interested in Cancer Research to use the portal in a 
					more efficient way.</p>
					
					<p>We have also participated in the last year’s Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 
					Program for two separate projects under the NRNB organization. The first 
					project, a Cytoscape 3.0 Application to facilitate downloading cancer 
					genomics data through the cBioPortal Web API services, was successfully lead 
					by Dazhi Jiao under the advisement of two members from our group. This 
					Cytoscape 3.0 application allows users to download data from cBioPortal, 
					visualize it in the network context either in an overall or sample-specific 
					manner, and analyze it with the help of additional Cytoscape 3.0 applications
					(see Figure 2). The source code for this project is freely available at our 
					<a href="http://bit.ly/cbioportal">Google Code project web site</a>. The 
					software implementation for this project is currently being finalized 
					and we are planning to distribute this application through Cytoscape’s App 
					Store interface in the next year.

					<b>Figure 2.</b> A screenshot of the Mondrian application, an open-source project 
					conducted as part of the Google Summer of Code 2012 project. The image shows 
					how genomics data, downloaded from the cBioPortal through this application, 
					is being overlaid onto the user’s network of interest. Once the data is 
					loaded from the cancer studies of interest through the cBioPortal’s Web Api, 
					users have the option to explore multi-dimensional cancer-related data within
					Cytoscape framework in a fashion that is similar to cBioPortal’s network 
					analysis feature.</p>
					
					<p>Our second GSoC project was lead by the summer student, Istemi Bahceci 
					under the co-advisement of one member of our group in conjunction with our 
					NRNB-collaborator Ugur Dogrusoz at Bilkent University. The aim of this 
					project was to extend CytoscapeWeb to support the Systems Biology Graphical 
					Notation (SBGN) for more detailed biological pathway visualization. This 
					project was completed over the last summer and we are currently integrating 
					it into the cBioPortal’s to provide better network analysis options for users.</p>
					
					<p><b>New Driving Biological Projects:</b> In the next year, we are 
					anticipating improving the network analysis feature in two ways: 1) detailed 
					visualization of the pathways and reactions in the network view; 2) inference 
					of indirect drug targets, for potentially interesting therapy options, by 
					using genomic alteration and drug-target data. Currently, interaction types 
					that are shown in the network analysis view are derived from the BioPAX to 
					SIF inference rules [7]. For example: In Same Component indicates that Genes 
					A and B are involved in the same biological component, such as a complex; 
					State Change indicates that Gene A causes a state change, such as a 
					phosphorylation change within Gene B. This reduction from BioPAX to SIF was 
					necessary as the Cytoscape Web framework, by then, was not supporting 
					visualization of more complex elements, such as compartments. With the 
					technology being developed as part of the CSP-100 project (Gary Bader), it 
					recently become feasible to visualize biological networks in a more detailed 
					way, therefore enabling the use of Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) 
					for better representation of BioPAX. As part of our NRNB collaboration with 
					Ugur Dogrusoz (Bilkent University, Turkey), we are aiming to adopt 
					SBGN-complaint views to visualize multi-dimensional cancer genomics data with 
					the network context (see Figure 3). This project has recently been 
					implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype and is now being integrated into 
					cBioPortal. When complete, this new feature will allow better presentation of 
					proteomics data (e.g. Reverse Phase Protein Array data provided as part of 
					the TCGA network) by allowing users to optionally switch from 
					a gene-centric to protein-centric view.
					
					<img src="images/SanderF3.png" width="700" /> <br /> <b>Figure 3:
					Proposed additions to the current simple network view.</b> On the left is the
					Simple Interaction derived from BioPAX; on the right is an example 
					visualization of a BioPAX network obtained from Pathway Commons. The latter 
					is utilizing the new visualization capabilities, Systems Biology Graphical 
					Notation (SBGN), of the CytoscapeWeb project. The SBGN view provides a more 
					detailed representation of the pathway and also provides protein-centric view
					with Proteomics data mapped to specific proteins or 
					phospho-proteins.
					
					<p>In the next year, we are also planning to utilize genomic alteration and pathway data to infer 
					clinically relevant uses of drug-target data. For this, we intend to use down- and up-stream relationships 
					between genes to suggest drugs of possible interest that can indirectly target a particular genomic 
					alteration event in cancer samples (see Figure 4). One historical example for such cases is the use of 
					AKT inhibitors in patients who bear a homozygous PTEN deletion. Without the gene PTEN and its product, 
					Akt proteins, which are down-stream of PTEN, cannot be suppressed, and therefore are found to be 
					upregulated in cancer samples that have the homozygous PTEN deletion. In the presence of an AKT 
					inhibitor, this up-regulation effect can be counteracted. Another similar example of this concept is 
					the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors when CDKN2A is either mutated or homozygously deleted in cancer cells. 
					Pathway resources, such as Pathway Commons, already provide this type of relationships between genes; 
					and we plan to extract this information in a systematic way and combine it with the drug-target data 
					in order to infer such therapy options in an automatic manner within the cBioPortal framework. This 
					method and the prototype are currently under development.

					<h4>Network Analysis Methods for Inferring Causality in Signaling Networks 
					(Sander, MSKCC)</h4>
					<p>The goal of our second TRD project is to develop network analysis tools 
					that algorithmically infer causality within signaling networks and make these
					tools available. High-throughput screens conducted with libraries of small 
					molecules or inhibitory RNAs have the ability to identify compounds that 
					induce tumor suppressive responses in cancer cells [12]. While the effects 
					of such perturbations can be easily linked to transcriptional changes, 
					identifying the causal mechanism is a main challenge. In collaboration 
					with Somwar and colleagues [13], we used a computational approach to predict 
					the target of a small molecule inducing reduced growth in lung adenocarcinoma
					cell lines. Interestingly, experimental follow up confirmed 
					the prediction.</p>
					<p>Building on this concept, we have been working on computational approaches
					to model causal signaling cascades inducing observed transcriptional changes 
					within perturbed cancer cell lines. We have been exploring the use of 
					optimization algorithms adapted from statistical physics to identify the 
					minimal set of interactions able to connect genes that are differentially 
					expressed after a perturbation, with candidate targets of the same 
					perturbation. This initial approach relied on an algorithm 
					that solves the Steiner-tree problem. Given a set of “terminal” nodes, the Steiner-tree is defined 
					as the tree of minimum weight connecting these terminals, allowing the inclusion of additional nodes. 
					Differentially expressed genes after a perturbation and/or candidate targets of the same perturbation 
					can be used as terminals. Our prediction was that the resulting Steiner-tree could therefore contain 
					both gene interactions able to explain the observed transcriptional changes and the putative target 
					of the perturbation. Within this past year, we determined that this approach does not work as well 
					as expected, and are now in the process of exploring a new algorithmic framework that combines 
					Gaussian graphical models with maximum entropy methods.</p>
					<p><b>New Driving Biological Projects</b><br />A new biological driver for deriving causality networks 
					is inferring causal relationships within data types and between data types, such as copy number 
					changes and cancer genomics. For example, we would like to investigate the relationship between 
					mutations in the TP53 tumor repressor and the complex copy number profile in ovarian cancer. Another 
					example is the exploration of causal relationships between gene mutations. For example, mutations in 
					the POLE gene lead to a characteristic spectrum of mutations in other proteins. We have preliminary 
					results and plan to develop a network analysis approach to identify causal relationships.
					</p><p>We are also considering looking at interactions between microbial subpopulations, starting with 
					the gut microbiome, where a set of interacting bacterial populations change under fluctuating constraints 
					provided by the host and nutrient intake. Recent work has shown the precise composition and evolution 
					of this population is closely coupled to the state of health of the host. Certain deviations from 
					equilibrium present a significant risk of invasion by pathogenic bacteria, as seen with some cancer 
					patients receiving bone marrow transplantations [23]. A more detailed understanding of the relationships 
					between gut microbial subpopulations following such aggressive treatments in the host could inform 
					therapeutic development leading to improved outcomes.</p>

					<p>
						<b>Introduction: <br /></b>Social networks are increasingly recognized as having an important
						effect on a wide variety of human behaviors, affecting the spread
						of health outcomes (AIDS, obesity, drinking and smoking behavior),
						emotional states (depression, loneliness, and happiness), and
						political outcomes (legislative activity, judicial decisions, and
						terrorist events). However, the statistical tools used to study
						these effects are drawn from a tradition that focuses on dyads, or
						sets of two people who are socially connected. When we find an
						association in behavior within dyads, we typically cannot
						distinguish three possible explanations. 1) <i>Homophily:</i>
						people might choose to be friends with others because they have
						the same behavior. In other words, birds of a feather might flock
						together. 2) <i>Context:</i> there might be variation in the
						environment than causes both individuals in a dyad to exhibit the
						same behavior. For example, poor neighborhoods might create
						environments that promote less healthy behaviors, causing an
						association between friends who live in the same neighborhood. 3)
						<i>Influence:</i> one person in the dyad actually influences the
						other in some way to cause their behavior to become more like
						their own.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the Network Correlation plugin developed in 
						collaboration with Alex Pico's group last year, we have now also 
						used Cytoscape to study the network of interactions in the Olfactory 
						system for a manuscript on “Friendship and Natural Selection” 
						. A theory paper predicting what we observe here was 
						published last year [1]. The target audience for this work is other 
						social network scholars and people interested in applying these 
						techniques to social network data. In our friendship and natural 
						selection paper we show that friends are more genetically related 
						than strangers, to the tune of about fourth cousins. So any project 
						that takes into account population structure might also consider 
						structure induced by friendship. And if there are gene 
						characteristics available in Cytoscape, we could apply the Network 
						Correlation plugin to see how far in gene-gene interaction networks 
						these characteristics tend to correlate.
					</p>
					<p>In terms of Cytoscape integration with our new work, it would be great 
					to have a database of natural selection scores available for each gene in 
					human studies, so scholars could easily visualize what parts of their network
					are under recent natural selection. We have Pardis Sabeti’s Composite of 
					Multiple Signals scores for about 3 million SNPs. It would also be nice to 
					have easily available within Cytoscape tools for translating from SNPs to 
					genes. We will work with the Cytoscape team to make natural selection data 
					available and to implement methods for its visualization. This work might 
					relate to the visualization TRDs by Bader and Pico groups within NRNB.</p>
					
					<p><b>Social Networks and Health</b><br />
					We originally proposed using trend motifs as a new statistical method to 
					investigate "Social Networks and Disease". We are no longer working on this 
					because we have come to believe there are other methods that are more 
					suitable. So we are now at Stage 1 in our work on "Social Networks and 
					Health", which has already led to a number of publications:

					Medicine</i> 74 (7), 1125–1129 (March 2012)</li>

					forthcoming</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
					The target audience for this work includes scholars in public health. 
					There are also some non-health-related projects that will be precursors to 
					a new project in which we will match death records to the Facebook data to 
					ascertain social network correlates of health:
					<ul>
					<li>Jones JJ, Settle JE, Bond RM, Fariss CJ, Marlow C, Fowler JH.  Inferring

					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
					This work might be ideally suited for a supplement grant. We would use the 
					Facebook and death data to predict longevity and health factors that 
					influence it (like MI). Next, we would develop and disseminate a Facebook 
					App that anyone can download that will give them health stats based on their 
					data.  We could then use Cytoscape to show people their networks and the 
					health risks of their friends and friends’ friends.<br />

					<h4>Cytoscape 3.0 and CytoscapeWeb for the Visualization and Representation 
					of Biological Networks (Bader, U Toronto) </h4>
					<p><b>Technologies developed with NRNB funds:</b><br />
					Our goal is to develop new technologies for visualization and representation 
					of biological networks. 
					Our grant aims are:
					<ul>
					<li><b>Aim 1.</b> Simplifying network views by hierarchically organizing 
					networks and their modules.</li>
					<li><b>Aim 2.</b> Showing only the information needed across multiple levels 
					of detail (semantic zooming) 
					and data sources (information layering)</li>
					<li><b>Aim 3.</b> Simultaneously viewing network attributes collected from 
					many biological experiments. </li>	
					</ul>
					<p>Our major activity over the past year has continued to ensure that Cytoscape 
					3.0 supports the advanced visualization and representation features that we 
					proposed in the NRNB grant, both in system design and performance. This has 
					required major effort working on releasing Cytoscape 3.0 and making sure all 
					of the application programming interfaces (APIs) present in that system will 
					support our aims. Cytoscape 3.0 has now been released and we are focusing on 
					developing new features. Over the past year, we implemented support for multiple
					renderers so app authors can contribute their own visualizations. We helped 
					integrate the Metanodes plugin into Cytoscape 3 as CyGroups in collaboration 
					with Scooter Morris at UCSF, which enables hierarchical views. We developed 
					technology to integrate OpenGL into Cytoscape, which required changes to the 
					code building process. This will support faster new visualizations in the future 
					that take advantage of current graphics card functionality. We also mentored a 
					GSoC project for visualizing dynamic networks (e.g. networks that vary over time).
					</p>
					<p>Excitingly, we have also ported over the CytoscapeWeb visualization tool that 
					we originally developed for the GeneMANIA project to use open web standards 
					such as HTML5. This software is now available at 
					github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js. This involved testing various HTML5 canvas 
					and WebGL based libraries for rendering networks within the browser, such as 
					Three.js, KineticJS, EaselJS, performing performance testing using WebGL directly 
					for drawing networks using HTML5 technology, performing performance testing using 
					HTML5 canvas directly and finally implementing a complete HTML5 canvas based 
					rendered that is fully compatible with touch devices, like the Apple iPad. 
					This technology will improve accessibility of Cytoscape visualizations by 
					supporting any computing device that runs a modern web browser (many of which 
					can not run the Cytoscape Java application). As more groups develop web-based 
					network visualization and analysis functionality, we expect extensive innovation 
					in user interfaces and visualization techniques to occur on this platform. We 
					are also continuing to lay the groundwork for representation and visualization 
					of detailed biological pathway information in Cytoscape 3. We have completed 
					the following activities in this area:
					<ul>
					<li>Developed a new CyPath2 Cytoscape 3.0 app, which can load biological 
					pathway data from the Pathway Commons web service in BioPAX level 3 format.</li>
					<li>Updated BioPAX and Pathway Commons core plugins/apps for Cy2 and Cy3</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Ensuring Cytoscape 3 will enable our stated aims has required tremendous 
					effort, in that we have need to implement a number of prototype features to 
					test that our API designs are robust. We expect this work will pay off in 
					2013 now that we have finally released Cytoscape 3 and have started working 
					on novel visualization features in earnest.</p>
					<p>We continue to maintain our highly successful Enrichment Map visualization 
					plugin for Cytoscape 2.8, responding to frequent requests by users for new 
					features. This visualization tool is heavily used in all of our collaborations 
					with local biology groups and by others (the two papers describing the method 
					garnered over 90 citations since 2010). We have recently established a 
					collaboration with Jill Mesirov’s group at the Broad Institute, MIT to integrate 
					Enrichment Map into their popular Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. 
					This work, funded by a separate NIH R01 grant, is now complete and will be 
					released in the coming months.</p>
					<p>Over the past year, we have developed strong ties with a new driving 
					biological project – the 
					<a href="http://oicr.on.ca/oicr-programs-and-platforms/innovation-programs/cancer-stem-cells">
					Cancer Stem Cell program</a> at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) 
					in Toronto, led by John Dick, the discoverer of cancer stem cells. Fifteen labs 
					participate in this program, most of which run genomics experiments and are very 
					interested in pathway analysis to help interpret their results. As such, they 
					have funded two full time research associates in my lab, Veronique Voisin who 
					does pathway analysis using Enrichment Map and Shaheena Bashir, who is a 
					biostatistician who processes raw genomics data to prepare for pathway analysis. 
					This has led to the four published projects in the past year.</p>
					
					<h4>Analyzing Complex Networks Using Ontologies and Cytoscape 3.0 (Alex Pico, 
					Gladstone/UCSF)</h4>
					<p>To make use of the vast wealth of data and knowledge to elucidate the 
					function of biological networks is one of the biggest challenges in 
					bioinformatics. The development of high-throughput technology has given rise 
					to an enormous increase of data on biomolecular expression and interactions, 
					which results in protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, 
					signaling networks and metabolic networks. One approach to understanding 
					networks relies on ontologies, such as Gene Ontology, and enrichment analysis. 
					Common approaches, such as BiNGO [1], regard a network as a list of genes, 
					performing gene-level annotation and enrichment methods. However, it is 
					apparent that the same list of genes with different interactions may perform 
					different functions. Thus, the functional analysis of networks should take 
					into consideration network topology.</p>
					<p>Following up on last year's work on the Mosaic app for the partitioning 
					and visualization of complex networks using Gene Ontology [2], we focused on 
					the development of the Network Ontology Analysis (NOA) app for Cytoscape. 
					The NOA app implements the NOA algorithm [3] for network-based enrichment 
					analysis, which extends Gene Ontology annotations to network links, or edges. 
					First, NOA assigns ontology terms to interactions based on the 
					known annotations of connected genes via optimizing two novel indexes 
					‘Coverage’ and ‘Diversity’. Then, NOA generates two alternative reference 
					sets to statistically rank the enriched functional terms for a given 
					biological network. NOA was shown to be more efficient not only for dynamic 
					regulatory networks but also for rewired protein interaction networks. 
					However, there are several shortcomings with the initial implementation: 
					no graphical interface or visualization of results; limited support for 
					species, gene names and ontology types; no batch mode for large-scale 
					computation; and no integration or interoperability with other network 
					tools. To overcome these shortcomings, we have reimplemented the NOA 
					algorithm as a Cytoscape app and added interfaces, extensible ontology and 
					identifier support, new visualizations, a batch mode, and interoperability 
					with other Cytoscape apps, such as CyThesaurus and Mosaic. The NOA 
					app facilitates the annotation and analysis of one or more networks in 
					Cytoscape according to user-defined parameters. In addition to tables, the 
					NOA plugin also presents results in the form of heatmaps and overview 
					networks in Cytoscape, which can be exported for publication figures. A 
					manuscript on this work is currently in review. 
					</p>
					<p><b>Application</b>
					As a proof-of-principle example, we prepared a file containing all the human 
					pathways curated at WikiPathways and translated Ensembl identifiers for batch
					mode analysis by the NOA plugin. We ran edge-based analysis to make use of 
					the interaction content in the pathways, rather than just treating them like 
					disconnected gene sets. Each pathway was analyzed against the entire 
					collection as reference and no correction was applied. As expected, curated 
					pathways of known function were significantly annotated with relevant GO 
					terms (Fig. 1). Users could add novel pathways or uncharacterized interaction
					networks to this batch analysis to assess functional annotation of edges in 
					the context of known biology.

					<p><b>Cytoscape 3.0:</b><br />
					Adding Dr. Scooter Morris to the Gladstone subcontract this year, we not only 
					gained a valuable Roving Engineer for training and outreach, but also a key 
					contributor to Cytoscape 3.0 design and development. During this reporting 
					period, Dr. Morris, worked on porting key plugins to 3.0, that other apps 
					depend on as well as many core features, including context menus, Tunables, 
					and custom graphics. As part of this work, he met with Bader lab members at 
					the University of Toronto to work on improving the user interface for the 
					VizMapper and extending Metanodes. He also improved the standardization of 
					the Cytoscape context menus and the esthetics of Cytoscape dialogs by 
					enhancing the Tunables interface. The focus of the Cytoscape 3 effort during 
					the later half of this reporting period has been the 3.0.1 release. 
					This is primarily a "bug-fix" release that follows on the heels of the 
					initial release of Cytoscape 3, and is intended to be the "solid" release we 
					want to advocate for new users. In addition to several general fixes, 
					Dr. Morris' work has addressed several issues with graphical annotations and 
					groups that are important for wider use.  We also began the design for an API 
					to export the functionality of graphical annotations to other apps, in 
					particular apps such as the GPML App, which will use these features to render
					pathway diagrams imported from the WikiPathways resource, which is another 
					NRNB-supported service.</p>

					<h4>The CYNI Modular Network Inference Framework</h4>
					<p>The objectives of this TRD work are to (1) Create 'fill-in-the-algorithm' 
					infrastructure for network inference and (2) Make methods accessible to 
					biologists within the Cytoscape framework. Our approach is to create a 
					software infrastructure (CYNI) for network inference algorithms (Fig 1).
					<img src="images/F20.png" width="700" /><br /> <b>Figure:</b>
					The CYNI framework extends Cytoscape to support an iterative
					computational-experimental cycle for network-based modeling.
					</p>
					<p>During this reporting period, we made progress on the following fronts:
					<ul>
					<li>Working CYNI App</li>
					<li>Documented API</li>
					<li>User and CYNI App writer documentation</li>
					<li>Additional CYNI functionality: Discretization and Imputation</li>
					<li>Implemented and documented downloadable “Hello World examples”</li>
					<li>CYNI App presented at two French network biology meetings</li>
					<li>CYNI App and Comprehensive documentation publicly available</li>
					</ul>
					The project is now <a href="http://www.proteomics.fr/Sysbio/CyniProject">
					live</a> and is also available at the Cytoscape App Store. Data imputation 
					and discretization techniques are provided along with several known inference 
					algorithms to make this tool fully operational for any kind inference 
					requirement. While data imputation and discretization techniques allow you 
					modify Cytoscape tables, network inference algorithms produce a new network 
					after applying the chosen technique.
					</p>
					
					<p>Cyni Toolbox is not only an application to perform a result, but it also 
					provides a framework to other app developers to facilitate the implementation 
					of other algorithms. The goal of Cyni framework is to provide standardized, 
					extensible and configurable default solutions for all components different 
					from the core algorithms, such as GUI, parameter handling, configuration of 
					distance/similarity measures. Thereby, developers can focus on their core 
					expertise, instead of trying to spend significant effort constructing 
					software components foreign to their expertise. Once, you are familiar with 
					the principles of Cytoscape Apps, you will notice that there is a new concept
					to develop apps, which is to develop an app that depends on another API app. 
					This new option brings a new variety of possibilities but at the same time 
					requires app developers to be more rigorous on their developments. Cyni 
					provides two sets of elements grouped in two types called Algorithms and 
					Metrics, but also allows other app developers to create new Algorithms and 
					metrics through the Cyni framework. To help other app developers to create 
					any of these two types using the Cyni framework, we offer tutorials to show 
					how a new algorithm or metric can be easily developed through Cyni. 
					</p>
					<p>CYNI was presented at the French NETBIO network inference community 
					(Paris, Nov. '12) and at the Prospectom workshop (Grenoble, Dec. '12). 
					e received this feedback:
					<br />"I was very happy to hear that Cytoscape is going inferential :). 
					And that members of our community are interested in collaborating with 
					your to make their tools available in the form of network inference Apps!"
					<br />
					We also helped implement the first "non-native" CYNI plug-in, which tested 
					and evolved our API, UI elements and documentation. This was published this 
					year as a joint Bioinformatics Application Note [1]. There are other future 
					CYNI Apps in the works from the d'Alche-Buc lab [2]. Overall, we aim to drive
					the evolution from network inference to iterative network modeling.</p>
